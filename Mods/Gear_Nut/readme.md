These are my magnetic and static stealth bed fans for the Micron

Magnetic mounts.

The wires are tucked underneath the magnets and held in place with friction fit. you wull need 6 3*6 magnets per side and be careful of the polarity! They should all face the same direction.

M3x6 to mount the magnetic mounts to the bed extrusions with a NDN worked well for me.

Wires will pass out either side of the mount and cross over the bed extrusion to the filter wagos or down into the Ebay if you chose. 

Static Mounts.

Same M3x6 to mount them to the frame. These will sit slightly lower than their magnetic counterparts but should not run or buzz on the panel. 

these have a hole through the center that should be wide enough for even a 4-wire fan if thats what you chose to use. 

If the fans will not stay friction fit inside the ducts there are provided m2x10 self tepping posts included as well. 

Print either the magnetic mounts or the static ducts you do not need both and they should be laid out in slicer for the best orientation I have found to print them in.
