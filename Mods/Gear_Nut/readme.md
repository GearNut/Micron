These are my magnetic and static stealth bed fans for the Micron

Magnetic mounts.

The wires are tucked underneath the magnets and held in place with friction fit. you wuill need 6 3*6 magnets perside and be careful of the polarity! They should all face the same direction.

M3x6 to mount the magnetic mounts to the bed exttusions with a NDN worked well for me. 

Static Mounts.

Same M3x6 to mount them to the frame. These will sit slightly lower than their magnetic counterparts but should not run or buzz on the panel. 

these have a hole through the center that should be wide enough for even a 4-wire fan if thats what you chose to use. 

If the fans will not stay friction fit inside the ducts there are provided m2x10 self tepping posts included as well.
